Bitcoin Rate Assessor
=====================

One page web app (implemented using AngularJS) that reads data from an [Indonesian Bitcoin exchange](https://www.bitcoin.co.id/), and compares the asks there to other exchanges around the world.

You can see a live demo [here](http://bitcoin.golightlyplus.com).
